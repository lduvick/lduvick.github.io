        <ul>
            <li><b>C:</b> Contrast is very all over the place, in some parts of the page it is decent, such as in the center, however dark orange and black do not contrast well nor does a white background on white and black text background </li>
            <li><b>R:</b> The repitition in this page is incredibly lacking as there is no uniformity thoughout the page whatsoever.</li>
            <li><b>A:</b> No two elements in the entire page are aligned fully.</li>
            <li><b>P:</b> Proximity of the website is also very poor as everything is grouped together on the left side no matter what it is</li>
        </ul><br><br>
        <h3><a href="https://www.etsy.com/?ref=lgo">Good Website: Etsy</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>C:</b> Contrast on Etsy is well done everything from text to images pops and draws your eyes to the items.</li>
            <li><b>R:</b> Repetition is incredibly professional everything is uniform but not to the point of redundancy.</li>
            <li><b>A:</b> Alignment is centered and every image and piece of text is aligned to the point you can make a grid out of the site.</li>
            <li><b>P:</b> Proximity is again very well done, all images are grouped together, all text is grouped together, menus are in a bar at the top.</li>
        </ul>
