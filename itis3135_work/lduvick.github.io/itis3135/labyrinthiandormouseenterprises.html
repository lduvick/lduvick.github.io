<h2>About the Company</h2>
<p>
    Labyrinthian Dormouse Enterprises is a small graphic design company that started in 2019 based in Charlotte, North Carolina and has grown to become a closely knit family enterprise. We have assisted many notorious clients 
    such as Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles with creating a website that speaks to their audience. We are originating from our two founders Bergs Bonni and Tasmina Devolo who started working as contracters and moved on to 
    successfully make their own buisness which has lead to our current position that we have today. Labyrinthian Dormouse Enterprises strives to obtain nationwide clientele while still maintaining the small family built 
    atmosphere that made us successful at the beginning.
